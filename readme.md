# React Learning Journey

## Redux

- I need a scaffolding tool to setup a React-Redux app quickly. Found [Neutrino](https://neutrinojs.org/)  via Google search.
- Followed official redux tutorial to go over implementation of concepts, but doing [my own dummy app](https://github.com/CodingFlow/react-redux).
- How do I get component level css? Looks like it's called css modules and Neutrino has it setup already. Moved my component styling into its own component stylesheet and referenced it in my component.

## Universal JS

- I need a way to serve up a React app server-side so I can look into mixing server-side and client-side rendering. Official React documentation references Next.js. Looks great, I'll use it.
